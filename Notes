Twitter logo

* Can't figure out the Twitter icon grid item. The hyperlink stretches across the entire header element,
    only want it to be the size of the icon.
* Twitter logo scales via @media, and gets too small when shrinking the page


HOW do I properly organize different webpages?
* For instance, code that will show up on everypage (navigation bar, footer info, social media links, etc.)
* How do I make the blog pages scaleable?
* I have to go back and make the same change on multiple pages - do I use javascript to
    create a script, and then just plug that in to each page, so that I can edit the javascript
    and it will take effect on all pages at the same time?
