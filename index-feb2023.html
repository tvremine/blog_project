        <h1>We're all Cyborgs, and it's fantastic</h1>

          <p>
            Have you ever felt disconnected from your phone? Does the thought of
            being away from the internet for even a minute fill you with dread?
          </p>
          <p>
            Congratulations, my friend, you're a cyborg! Yes, you read that
            right. As humans, we've reached a point where technology has become
            so ingrained in our daily lives that we've essentially become
            cyborgs. We may not have robot arms or bionic eyes (yet), but our
            smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets have become extensions of
            ourselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think about it: how often do you check your phone in a day? How many
            times have you googled something just to settle a debate? And don't
            even get me started on how reliant we've become on GPS for
            navigation. We may not have wires connecting us to our devices, but
            we're certainly dependent on them in a very real way.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's not just our personal devices that make us cyborgs.
            Artificial intelligence has become increasingly integrated into our
            lives, from Siri and Alexa to Netflix recommendations. We're
            constantly interacting with and relying on algorithms to make
            decisions for us.
          </p>

          <p>
            And let's not forget about the internet. It's the ultimate extension
            of our brains, allowing us to access information and communicate
            with people all over the world. We've even started to rely on social
            media as a way of defining our identities and connecting with
            others.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, what's next? Well, if we're already cyborgs, why not extend that
            to our pets? Imagine a world where cats are equipped with
            mini-computers that allow them to communicate with us in a more
            sophisticated way. They could send us texts when they want food or
            water, or even tell us which toy they want to play with. Plus, we
            could finally solve the age-old mystery of what cats are thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in all seriousness, the fact that we're already cyborgs is a
            testament to how far we've come as a society. It's also a reminder
            of how important it is to strike a balance between technology and
            humanity. So, the next time you find yourself mindlessly scrolling
            through your phone, remember that you're a cyborg - and
            <em>embrace it!</em>

            Hi I'm Tom. I used to program in C++ and languages similar to JS
            years ago, but only recently started to get back in the game. This
            is a sample project by me showcasing basic levels of HTML and CSS.
            Any feedback is appreciated, particularly links to good and RECENT
            video tutorials.
