        <h1>The Cyborgs are among us - a short story</h1>
        <p class="blog-date">December 24 @ 7:43pm EST, by Tom ReMine</p>

          <p>
            Meet Tom. The year is 2014 and he has just realized that he has
            super-human cyborg powers, thanks to the internet and cellular
            devices. With just a few taps on his smartphone, he can order a
            pizza, hail a ride, and buy cat toys for his feline friends. It's
            pretty amazing, but also somewhat overwhelming.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, Tom was thrilled with his newfound powers. He could keep
            up with his friends on social media, text his mom from across the
            country, and binge-watch his favorite shows on Netflix. But as time
            went on, he started to realize that these digital distractions were
            taking a toll on his interpersonal relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            He found himself checking his phone constantly, even when he was
            supposed to be hanging out with friends. He'd get lost in online
            debates or scrolling through endless cat videos, losing track of
            time and neglecting the people around him.
          </p>
          <img src="/images/cyborg-cat-DALLE2.png" />
          <p>
            Tom knew he needed to find a way to balance his digital life with
            his real life, but it was easier said than done. The more he tried
            to limit his screen time, the more he felt like he was missing out
            on something important.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, one day, Tom had an epiphany. He realized that his super-human
            cyborg powers weren't just about ordering pizza or watching cat
            videos - they were also a way for him to maintain contact with the
            people he loved. He could text his brother who lived across the
            country, or video chat with his best friend who was studying abroad.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, Tom decided to embrace his cyborg powers and use them for good.
            He made a conscious effort to put down his phone when he was with
            friends, but also used it to stay connected with those who were far
            away. He even started sending his cat-loving friends pictures of his
            feline companions, and using the internet to learn more about cat
            behavior and health.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Tom still gets distracted by the digital world from time
            to time. But now he knows how to harness his super-human cyborg
            powers for good, and use them to strengthen his relationships
            instead of detracting from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as for his cats? Well, let's just say that they're pretty happy
            with Tom's new obsession with cat toys and behavior. They might not
            be cyborgs themselves (yet), but they're certainly benefiting from
            Tom's super-human powers.

            Hi I'm Tom. I used to program in C++ and languages similar to JS
            years ago, but only recently started to get back in the game. This
            is a sample project by me showcasing basic levels of HTML and CSS.
            Any feedback is appreciated, particularly links to good and RECENT
            video tutorials.
