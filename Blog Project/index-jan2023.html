          Are Cyborgs the superior choice? The answer is a resounding

            Being a cyborg is super cool - and it's time we start embracing it.
            From smartphones to artificial limbs, technology has become so
            integrated into our daily lives that it's impossible to ignore. And
            for those with prosthetic limbs, being a cyborg comes with some
            pretty amazing benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            First and foremost, let's talk about the structural integrity of
            well-engineered prosthetics. These devices are designed to be
            incredibly strong and durable, making them far superior to a regular
            human limb in many ways. For example, someone with a mechanical or
            prosthetic arm could be much stronger than someone with a normal
            human arm. They could lift heavier weights, open jars with ease, and
            even crush a soda can with a single hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it's not just about physical strength - prosthetic limbs can
            also provide a sense of freedom and independence that may have been
            lost due to injury or illness. People with prosthetic legs can run
            and jump, while those with prosthetic arms can perform intricate
            tasks with precision and accuracy. They can even be customized to
            fit the individual's unique needs and preferences, allowing for a
            more personalized and comfortable experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another advantage of being a cyborg is the ability to integrate
            technology into the body. For example, there are prosthetic limbs
            that are controlled by the user's thoughts, allowing for a more
            natural and intuitive experience. This technology is constantly
            evolving, and we're seeing more and more innovative solutions that
            help people with disabilities live their lives to the fullest.
          </p>
          <p>
            But being a cyborg isn't just about having super strength or
            advanced technology. It's also about embracing a new identity and
            perspective. For those with prosthetic limbs, it can be a way of
            reclaiming their bodies and showing the world that they are just as
            capable and powerful as anyone else. It can also be a way of
            connecting with a larger community of people who have gone through
            similar experiences and understand the challenges and triumphs of
            living with a disability.

            Hi I'm Tom. I used to program in C++ adn languages similar to JS
            years ago, but only recently started to get back in the game. This
            is a sample project by me showcasing basic levels of HTML and CSS.
            Any feedback is appreciated, particularly links to good and RECENT
            video tutorials.
